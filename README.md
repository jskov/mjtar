# Overview

I need a java-tar for my backup project.

For some entertainment, I will try to modernize this fork of https://github.com/kamranzafar/jtar to Java 25.

There is no plan to contribute back to the parent repository (which looks both dead and cold).  
So I am switching the build system to Gradle, and moving to code to a new package.
